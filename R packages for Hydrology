https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Hydrology.html

*************************************
HYDROLOGICAL DATA ACQUISITION
*************************************
dataRetrieval: Retrieve USGS and EPA hydrologic and water quality data
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html

*****************
waterData: Retrieval, analysis, and calculations of anomalies of daily hydrologic time series data
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waterData/waterData.pdf

Imports U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) daily hydrologic data from USGS web services 
(see <https://waterservices.usgs.gov/> for more information), plots the data, 
addresses some common data problems, and calculates and plots anomalies.

*************************************
METEOROLOGICAL DATA ACQUISITION
*************************************
MODISTools: Downloads of MODIS time series
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODISTools/MODISTools.pdf

Programmatic interface to the Oak Ridge National Laboratories'MODIS Land Products Subsets' 
web services(<https://modis.ornl.gov/data/modis_webservice.html>). Allows for easy downloads 
of 'MODIS' time series directly to your R workspace or your computer.

*****************
RNRCS: Downloads Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) data 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNRCS/RNRCS.pdf

Downloads Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) data for sites in the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) 
<https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/scan/>, and Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL and SNOLITE) <https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/> networks. 
Metadata can be returned for all sites in the NRCS' Air and Water Data Base (AWDB) <https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/report_generator/AWDB_Network_Codes.pdf>

*****************
smapr: Acquisition and Processing of NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) Data
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smapr/smapr.pdf

Facilitates programmatic access to NASA Soil Moisture ActivePassive (SMAP) data with R. 
It includes functions to search for, acquire, and extract SMAP data


*************************************
HYDROGRAPH ANALYSIS
*************************************
fasstr: Analyze, Summarize, and Visualize Daily Streamflow Data
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fasstr/fasstr.pdf
https://rdrr.io/cran/fasstr/

The Flow Analysis Summary Statistics Tool for R, 'fasstr', provides various functions to tidy and screen daily stream discharge data; 
calculate and visualize various summary statistics and metrics; and compute annual trending (using 'zyp' package methods <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zyp>)
and volume frequency analyses (using methods similar to HEC-SSP (2019)<https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ssp/>). 
It features useful function arguments for filtering of and handling dates, customizing data and metrics.

*****************
hydrostats: Hydrologic Indices for Daily Time Series Data
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydrostats/hydrostats.pdf
https://rdrr.io/cran/hydrostats/

Calculates a suite of hydrologic indices for daily time series data that are widely used in hydrology and stream ecology.

*****************
hydroTSM: Time Series Management, Analysis and Interpolation for Hydrological Modelling
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroTSM/hydroTSM.pdf

S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and plotting of time series used in hydrology and related environmental sciences. 
In particular, this package is highly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. The focus of this package has been put in providing 
a collection of tools useful for the daily work of hydrologists 

*****************
hydroGOF: Goodness of Fit Functions for Comparison of Simulated and Observed Hydrological Time Series
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroGOF/hydroGOF.pdf

S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures between observed and simulated values, 
mainly oriented to be used during the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models.
